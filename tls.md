# TLS vs HTTPS

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that secures communication between systems, while HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that uses TLS to encrypt data transmitted between a client (browser) and a server (website). In essence, TLS provides the security layer, and HTTPS is an implementation of that security for web applications.
