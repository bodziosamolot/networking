# Host to host communication

- Happens in Layer 2 (sometimes layer 3)
- Each host has a network card with a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address
- Message is sent to everyone on the network
- Everyone else than the recepient will drop the message (in layer 2)
- In order not to send it to everyone routability is required, the IP address is required
- If only MAC addresses were used we would need to scan all MAC addresses in the world
